  "body": "The club operates throughout the whole year, with January being the only month without any planned sailing.  The sailing is planned around racing when safety cover is provided, however members can choose to participate in the races laid on, or just free sail during these times.\n\nThe year starts in February, for the hardy sailors, with the “Spring Splash” series running on Sunday mornings from 11:00am during February and March.\n\nThe main season gets underway on the last weekend in March with races scheduled for Sunday mornings (from 11:00am) and afternoons (from 2:00pm) running until the last weekend in October.\n\nDuring the summer months (April though August from 7:00pm) the club jointly runs Wednesday evening racing with Tynemouth.\n\nThe year is completed with a “Frostbite” series running on Sunday mornings from 11:00am during November and December, with the final festive sailing day of the year taking place on Boxing Day.\n\nDuring the summer the club also organises open days, youth events, and a regatta weekend which is a two day competition open to club members and visitors alike. The event is generally held in the open waters of the North Sea outside the piers.\n\n[Click here to see the schedule of races](https://halsail.com/Schedule/PublicCalendar/3440)",
