  "body": "Safety is of paramount importance to the club.   During organised club events at least one safety boat is on the water at all times to ensure the safety of all afloat.\n\n The club owns six Rigid Inflatable Boats (RIB), five of which are used to provide safety boat cover and one is used as the official start / finish boat for racing.  These are well equipped and have on board first aid kits and VHF radio to communicate with the club, harbour authorities, and coastguard in case of emergencies.   The boats are manned by club members on a rota basis.\n\nIn order to share the safety cover and race organisation each member is required to do around 3 rota sessions per year (safety boat, race officer, or kitchen duty) with inexperienced members being placed with experienced members."
