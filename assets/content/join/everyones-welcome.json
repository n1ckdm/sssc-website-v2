  "body": "South Shields Sailing Club is a friendly, family orientated club for dinghy, catamaran and windsurfers. We're [positioned](/about#map) in an ideal sailing location, right at the mouth of the river Tyne.  The club is run by friendly volunteers of all ages, and backgrounds.\n\nThe majority of our sailing takes place in the **mouth of the Tyne** river between the north and south piers, however we do venture out onto the open seas at various times throughout the year. If you're really lucky, the local dolphin pod will pay you a visit!\n\nWhy not come along to the club and see for yourself what it is all about?\n\nDuring the year we have club **Open Days** to allow potential members the opportunity to take a look around the club or try out sailing if they haven't been before. We put information about these on our [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/SouthShieldsSailingClub) page and here on our website."
