If you've already sailed before, then there's nothing stopping you from heading over to our Membership Website and signing up straight away!\n\nIf you're new to sailing, the most common routes to becoming a competent sailor are:\n\n* Participate in an open day\n* Take part in one of our RYA level 1 or 2 courses\n* Start sailing by yourself! We have club boats that members can hire\n* Or you could team up with someone that has a 2 person boat & crew for them\n\nRegister your interest on our members area [(Click here).](https://www.myclubhouse.co.uk/SSSC/Registration/Register)"
